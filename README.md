Locating Optimal Centering(s) by Understanding Stakeholders

This code is the result of a summer internship bleeding into a personal project. 
It could be used by small companies, places of worship, small schools or whatever!
The idea is to build a tool to understand how different test points affect overall commute statistics. 
I did it all in Google Colaboratory, and I suggest downloading the file and uploading it to that. 
Running in Colab is easy, but building the product out more may require shifting. 
If you are reading this and think it's interesting, please reach out and we can build this into a useful service for the world!


I need help!
